1. Real-Time Clock Functionality
This code snippet uses JavaScript to create a real-time clock. By leveraging the Date object, it retrieves the current hours, minutes, and seconds. The code then calculates the appropriate rotation angles for each clock hand and applies these transformations using CSS. The clock updates every second, ensuring the displayed time is always accurate and up-to-date.

2. Dynamic Rotation Calculations
The script dynamically computes rotation angles for the hour, minute, and second hands. The hour hand rotates based on both the current hour and minute, ensuring smooth transitions. The minute and second hands rotate proportionally to their respective values. These calculations enable the clock hands to move fluidly, closely mimicking the behavior of an analog clock.

3. Seamless User Experience
Using setInterval, the clock hands are updated every 1000 milliseconds, ensuring continuous movement and an accurate representation of the current time. The combination of JavaScript and CSS transforms provides a visually appealing, responsive clock that can be easily integrated into any webpage, enhancing the user experience by adding a functional and interactive element.
